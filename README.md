# Javascript 2.5D Tile Map Editor (in Minecraft styling)

This is a vanilla JavaScript implementation of a tile map editor. It is a modification of a previous implementation by Robert Friedl using JQuery, the current implementation is done by MBUKH.DEV in vanilla Javascript.

The program allows you to create a map using multiple layers of tiles. You can adjust the zoom level, move the map around and change the active tool to draw or erase tiles.

Click on a tile to draw or erase it on the active layer.
Use the mouse scroll or the zoom buttons to adjust the zoom level.
Click on the map and drag to move it around.
